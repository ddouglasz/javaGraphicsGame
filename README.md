A Graphics project i created while taking stanford CS106A class online(JAVA class).
it is a simple beginning of a shooting game i named ZombieRush. I hope i find someone willing to learn and complete it with Me soon(I WOULD BE VERY GLAD!). 

NOTE: This is one of my first encounters with java(Most of the implementations may not be professionally arranged or even properly implemented). The goal is for me to get other people willing to complete the project and also learn from it too(especially freshers to to learn from).

i would be very happy to see people cme up cool ideas to finish the project although the graphics are a bit primitive.

PREREQUISITE TO RUN THIS PROJECT:
You need the customized Stanford eclipse compiler (it was easy for me to compile with theirs when i first started learning) and JRE.
